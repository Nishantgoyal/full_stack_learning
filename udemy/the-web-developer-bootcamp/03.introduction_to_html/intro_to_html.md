### Anatomy of an HTML element

The main parts of our element are as follows:

1. **The Opening tag:** Consists of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing brackets
2. **The Closing tag:** Same as opening tag but include a *forward slash* before the element name
3. **The Content**
4. **Attributes:** These may be optional or mandatory, and contain extra information about the element

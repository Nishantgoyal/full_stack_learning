# Jumbotron

A lightweight flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key component to your site.
Enable it by adding the class `jumbotron`.
To make the jumbotron full width and without rounded corners, place it outside all `.container`s and instead add a `.container` within.

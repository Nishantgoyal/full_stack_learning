# Forms

Individual form controls automatically receive some global styling.  
All textual `<input>`, `<textarea>` and `<select>` elements with `.form-control` class are set to `width: 100%`.  
Wrap labels and controls in `.form-group` for optimum spacing.  
Add `.form-inline` class to your form for left-aligned and inline-block controls.  
**Horizontal Form:** Using Bootstrap's predefined grid classes to align labels and groups of form controls in a horizontal layout by adding `.form-horizontal` to the form. It makes `.form-group` behave as rows.

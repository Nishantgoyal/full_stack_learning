# Cards

Provides a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options.

It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.

Replace `panels`, `wells` and `thumbnails` from bootstrap 3.

Built with flexbox, cards offer easy alignment.

They have no `margin` by default.

Cards have no fixed width to start, and will naturally expand to fill the entire width of the container.

## Content Types

These support a wide variety of content, including images, text, etc.

- **Body**
  - The building block of a card is `.card-body`
  - Use it when you need a padded section within a card.
- **Title, Text and Links**
  - Card titles are used by adding a `.card-title` to a `<h*>` tag.
  - Links are added and placed to each other by adding `.card-link` to an `<a>` tag.
